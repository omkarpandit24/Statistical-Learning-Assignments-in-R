# Statistical-Learning-Assignments-in-R
This repository contains the scripts developed as in class exercises to understand statistical aspects behind Machine Learning algorithms. Coding was done in R.
This course focused on methods that allow learning from datasets to uncover underlying relationships and patterns in the data.
The course started with a review of basic statistical concepts and linear regression. Mainly it focused on classification and clustering based on non-regression techniques such as tree-based approaches,support vector machines, and unsupervised learning.
The course emphasized both on formulaic and conceptual understanding of the discussed methods.
